	Corail Tombstone (Corail Tombstone 4.2.4 for 1.14.4 --> Corail Tombstone 4.3.1 for 1.14.4):
		Corail Tombstone 4.3.1 for 1.14.4:
			This mod supports mc version from 1.8.9 to 1.15.2
			Minecraft Version = [1.14.4] - Forge Version [28.1.58+]
			Latest : 4.3.1 - Recommended : 4.3.1
			Changes 4.3.1 :
			* - "magic items" by fishing in the junk lootable requires an open water space for the entity hook (in prevision of 1.16, don't try to make a hole ;))
			* client config to define the fog color (this doesn't influence what is seen by others players)
			* client config to define when fog can appear (day, night, both, never)
			* something
			Changes 4.3.0 :
			* - projectiles (by using the left hand) don't apply the tombstone weapon enchantments of the mainhand
			* fix the translation of earn/lose knowledge (from the previous version changes)
			* remove perk entries from the api (related to forge error handling)
			* adapt skull reward from the advancement about the favorite grave (as only undead skulls/heads are useable for decorative grave)
			* compat with minecolonies : killing citizens, pirates & barbarians affect player's alignment
			* config to define the level required for familiar receptacle (10 by default)
			* adjust contributor rewards to fit the latest contents
			* config to define the duration of scrolls
			* config to backup players just before their death (default is false)
			* client config option to favor the tools on the hotbar when recovering a grave
			* same sync on config file change for client config being shared on the server (the config gui already does it)
			* re-add the original tombstone model (adapted)
			* anvil recipes for white marble grave are now visible in JEI (engraved name)
			Changes 4.2.4 :
			* integration TheOneProbe
			* display the Y on lost tablet tooltip before the first teleportation
			* re-use the same casting particle texture as 1.12.2
			* new enchantment Plague Bringer (can't combine with Magic Siphon)
			* config to limit Plague Bringer to bad alignment player (or he will be affected with the same bad effect) - default true
			* config for unhandled harmful effects with nausea in by default (also rename the config for beneficial effects)
			* avoid a vanilla bug where onEntityDamaged is called twice for player for the mainhand
			* limit plague bringer & magic siphon to be effective only on mainhand
			Changes 4.2.3 :
			* server configs are now in the usual config folder (#135)
			* sync the server config to players on dedicated server (without the need to relog)
			Changes 4.2.2 :
			* disabled magic items in config also disable the recipes in game (some of them have now a custom serializer "tombstone:disableable_shaped", "tombstone:disableable_shapeless" and are still editable in json for modpackers)
			* loot entries are now done in builder allowing them to not be present when the magic item is disabled (require to reload the game)
			* new item "tablet of cupidity" : a deceitful craftable version of lost tablets leading to others places
			* remove beyondTheGrave damages from lost tablets
			* update chinese translation (courtesy of Papadave66)
			Changes 4.2.1 :
			* spanish translation (courtesy of EdicionGamer)
			* a new perk Tomb Raider, for bad alignement player and if the config option Tomb Raiding is enabled, allowing to plunders some items in an abandoned grave. A grave is considered as abandoned based on the real time of the server : it's one day by default if the decayTime is not enabled and in the other case, it uses the decayTime adjusted by the level of knowledge of death of the plunderer (to allow them to acces faster theses graves than others players with a cap of 50% faster). The number of stolen items is variable and it's possible to not find all the items.
			* hide disable items in creative tabs
			* additional checks about cooldown if the gametime changes to an inconsistent value
			* some configs are now in the world save folder/serverConfig

			* Dikes are more based on their size attribute
			* Here's how a smaller hematite dike of size 24 looks:
			4.0.10
			Changed
			* Calculations on how many samples are generated, since this is now different due to how new deposit types work
			* Made ProPick overlay text translatable
			* ProPick overlay text is now in form of Depth: +<x>m, Depth: -<x>m, or Depth: 0m
			4.0.9

			* Text in each resource entry letting you know what type of pluton it forms in
			Fixed
			* The size setting of a DIKE pluton having no effect
			4.0.8
			Added
			*
			New Pluton Types!! They come in four variants:
			* Dense (same as the old ones)
			* Dike (A vertical column of ore)
			* Sparse (Scattered within the chunk boundaries)
			* Layer (A few circular-ish layers of ore)
			Fixed
			* Field Manual not respecting config option
			* Field Manual being given multiple times
			* Cassiterite not dropping anything
			* Possibly being given the Field Manual multiple times
			* Disabling Field Manual gifting not working
			4.0.7
			Fixed
			* Sample bounding boxes being centered on the block, but the actual sample being off-centered
			4.0.6
			Added
			* ProPick Extras (a config option to let you define other blocks the propick should pick up on)
			* Sample Placement Blacklist config option
			Changed
			* The defaultReplacementMats option is now a list of strings, instead of a single large string
			* Samples will now be generated even smarter than before, checking if the block they're placing on is in the samplePlacementBlacklist (a new config option) or is the top solid (a requirement for the sample block itself too)
			Fixed
			4.0.5
			Fixed
			* Nether Quartz generating in the Nether
			4.0.4
			Fixed
			* Kimberlite samples not dropping anything

			* Field Manual is back! Everything's working! (I think)
			* Field Manual is gifted to you once (can be configured not to)

			4.0.1
			Added
			* Compatability drops (waiting on [this bug to be fixed](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/5828)) - once the bug is fixed it should work without me updating
			* Ability to gift players a (currently non-functioning 🤔) Field Manual the first time they join the game - there is a config for this.
			Changed
			* Internal API stuff to make sure pending blocks work consistently.
			* ProPick Recipe (It's now three iron aross the top row, two sticks down the remaining empty right columns)

			4.0.0
			What Works
			* All ore gen and stone gen, just like how it used to work
			* JSON customization, just like it was
			* Most other major components except for what's listed below:
			What Hasn't Been Implemented Yet
			* Campatibility drops (waiting on [this bug to be fixed](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/5828))
			* Geolosys "RetroGen"
			* Most user entries
			* Most mod compat
			What has been Permanently Removed
			* Some compatibility - not much, but some of it was modifying drops (e.g. Nuclearcraft compat). This has been permanently removed because you can change this yourself using a datapack!.
			Mod Changes
			* Samples can break if you fall on them
			* Samples can now be waterlogged (hence there isn't a "can place in water" config because they should always be able to).
			* Samples now have random X/Z offsets (like flowers) for more realistism
			* dimBlacklist is no longer a list of integers (e.g. [-1, 1]) - it's now a string of resource locations (e.g. ["the_end", "extrautils2:deep dark"], etc.)
			* Propick recipe: no longer requires an iron block (that didn't make sense)
			API Changes
			* The API has been moved out of the common package and into the main geolosys package.
			* IOre → IDeposit
			*  The API is now much reduced - the API now only consists of:
			*  GEOLOSYS_WORLD_CAPABILITY: The capability used for storing:
			* What chunks have already had ore plutons checked for
			* What chunks have already had stone plutons checked for
			* What chunks have already been retrogenned (not yet used)
			* Pending blocks per-chunk (blocks that need to be placed at a blockpos but haven't been because that would cause cascading lag)
			* proPickExtras: Extra BlockState entries to look for when prospecting
			* oreConverterBlacklist: Which ores not to convert as a part of "retrogenning" (not yet used)
			* A PlutonRegistry instance, allowing access to add, get and remove all ore and stone IDeposits used by Geolosys
			* New BlockPosDim class for dimension-defined BlockPoses (used for pending blocks)
			* Move BlockPosDim/ChunkPosDim to their own classes for clarity
