### Introduction

The server start scripts were made by the AllTheMods team, but they have stopped working on it, and are not merging pull requests.

The scripts have been modified by NillerMedDild to run on 1.14+, please report bugs to the [Enigmatica 4 GitHub](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica4/issues).

### Usage

Fill in either `settings.cfg` or `settings-linux`, depending on your system, and then run the appropriate `server-start` script - The `server-start.sh` script needs to be run with Bash.
