### Introduction

The server start scripts were made by the AllTheMods team, but they have stopped working on it, and are not merging pull requests.

The scripts have been modified by NillerMedDild to run on 1.14+, please report bugs to the [Enigmatica 4 GitHub](https://github.com/NillerMedDild/Enigmatica4/issues).

### Usage

Copy all files from the `include-in-server-files` folder (this one) into the main Minecraft server folder, the same folder that contains mods, config and so on.

Fill in either `settings.cfg` or `settings-linux`, depending on your system, and then run the appropriate `server-start` script - The `server-start.sh` script needs to be run with Bash.
